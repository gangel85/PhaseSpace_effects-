# PhaseSpace_effects-

This code computed Phase Spaces effects based on the transverse momentum correlation of quarks. A Gaussian ansatz is assumed due to to the assumption of producion of transverse momentum due to Fermi motion in the proton, and of quantum tunneling in the quarks.
Due to the constrain of energy conservation a  truncated multivariate Gaussian is used to define the phase space correction,this model supported by a maximum entropy probaiblity approach. 
The code perform analysis on the transverse momentum distribution of pion compared to the generated model and define the correction fuctions to apply to raw data in order to re establish the orginal Gaussian starting from the observed truncated one.

The code provides all useful plots for interepretation of the data.
